# Masjid Display Screen Implementation Notes

This document outlines the changes made to implement the Masjid Display Screen Integration Guide requirements and provides testing instructions.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. New API Client

Created a new `MasjidDisplayClient` class that follows the best practices from the integration guide:

- **Secure credential storage**: API key and screen ID are stored in secure local storage
- **Proper authentication headers**: Headers are included with every request
- **Caching strategy**: All responses are cached with appropriate expiration times
- **Offline handling**: Requests are queued when offline and processed when back online
- **Exponential backoff**: Implemented for failed requests to reduce server load
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation

### 2. Updated Polling Frequencies

Implemented the recommended polling intervals:

| Endpoint | Polling Interval |
|----------|------------------|
| `/api/screen/heartbeat` | Every 60 seconds |
| `/api/screen/content` | Every 5 minutes |
| `/api/screen/prayer-status` | Every 30 seconds |
| `/api/screen/prayer-times` | Once daily |
| `/api/screen/events` | Every 30 minutes |

### 3. Enhanced Data Sync Service

Refactored the data sync service to:

- Use separate sync intervals for different types of data
- Implement proper offline handling
- Provide better error handling and logging
- Use the new API client with caching

### 4. Structured Logging

Implemented a structured logging system that:

- Logs with appropriate levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Includes timestamps and screen ID
- Stores error information for heartbeat reporting
- Maintains a log history for troubleshooting

### 5. Context Updates

Updated the AuthContext and ContentContext to work with the new API client.

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Basic Functionality Testing

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Clear local storage and reload the app
   - Verify the pairing flow works correctly
   - Check that credentials are stored securely

2. **Content Display**:
   - Verify that prayer times are displayed correctly
   - Check that the prayer status updates appropriately
   - Ensure events are displayed correctly

### 2. Network Resilience Testing

1. **Offline Mode**:
   - Load the app and let it sync data
   - Disconnect from the network (turn off Wi-Fi/airplane mode)
   - Verify the app continues to function with cached data
   - Check for appropriate offline indicators

2. **Reconnection**:
   - While offline, make note of the displayed data
   - Reconnect to the network
   - Verify the app automatically syncs and updates with fresh data

### 3. Caching Testing

1. **Cache Expiration**:
   - Monitor network requests using browser dev tools
   - Verify that repeated requests for the same endpoint within the cache window use cached data
   - Confirm that requests are made after cache expiration

2. **Cache Fallback**:
   - Simulate API errors (e.g., by disconnecting network during a request)
   - Verify the app falls back to cached data

### 4. Error Handling Testing

1. **Authentication Errors**:
   - Invalidate the API key (e.g., by clearing it from storage but not the UI state)
   - Verify the app attempts to re-authenticate

2. **Server Errors**:
   - Simulate 500 errors (can be done with network interceptors in dev tools)
   - Verify the app implements backoff and retries
   - Check that it falls back to cached data after max retries

### 5. Performance Testing

1. **Memory Usage**:
   - Monitor memory usage in browser dev tools over extended periods
   - Verify there are no memory leaks

2. **CPU Usage**:
   - Monitor CPU usage during sync operations
   - Ensure the app remains responsive during background syncs

## Troubleshooting

If issues are encountered during testing:

1. Check the browser console for structured log messages
2. Verify network connectivity
3. Clear local storage and reload if authentication issues persist
4. Check that the API endpoints are correctly configured in the environment variables

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a more sophisticated offline queue with persistence
2. Add a debug mode UI for viewing logs and cache status
3. Implement conditional requests with If-Modified-Since headers
4. Add more comprehensive metrics for performance monitoring
