# MasjidConnect Display App Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing the MasjidConnect Display App, a digital signage solution for mosques to display prayer times, announcements, events, and other content.

## Important Note: No User Input Design

**The MasjidConnect Display App is designed as a "no user input" application.** This means:

- End users should not interact with the application
- The display is meant to be mounted in public areas of the mosque
- All content management is done through the MasjidConnect management portal
- The only user interaction is during initial setup (pairing)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current Phase)

- Basic application setup with React and TypeScript
- Authentication and pairing system
- Prayer times display
- Offline data storage
- Responsive layouts for different orientations

### Phase 2: Content Display

- Content rotation system
- Announcement displays
- Event listings
- Islamic content (verses, hadiths, etc.)
- Custom content support

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Multi-language support
- Advanced theming options
- Animation and transitions
- Audio capabilities (adhan notifications)
- Remote control and monitoring

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Framework

- React with TypeScript
- Material UI for components
- Context API for state management

### Data Storage

- LocalForage for offline data storage
- Service workers for caching and offline functionality

### API Communication

- Axios for API requests
- WebSocket for real-time updates (future)

### Deployment

- Progressive Web App (PWA) for cross-platform compatibility
- Docker container for dedicated hardware

## Key Components

### Authentication Flow

1. Display generates a random 6-digit pairing code
2. Administrator enters the code in the MasjidConnect management portal
3. Backend associates the display with the mosque account
4. Display receives API credentials and begins syncing content

### Data Synchronization

- Periodic API calls to fetch updated content
- Heartbeat mechanism to indicate display status
- Offline caching for continued operation during connectivity loss
- Background sync when connection is restored

### Layout System

- Responsive design adapts to screen size and orientation
- Landscape layout: Prayer times sidebar with main content area
- Portrait layout: Prayer times header with main content below
- Automatic orientation detection and switching

## User Experience Considerations

### Display Readability

- Large, clear typography for prayer times
- High contrast colors for visibility
- Appropriate spacing for viewing from a distance

### Content Rotation

- Smooth transitions between content items
- Appropriate display duration based on content type
- Priority system for important announcements

### Offline Experience

- Seamless transition between online and offline modes
- Clear indication when content is not current
- Graceful degradation of features

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure

- Feature-based organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Strong typing with TypeScript
- Comprehensive documentation

### Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient rendering with React.memo and useMemo
- Minimizing bundle size
- Optimized images and assets

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- End-to-end tests for critical flows
- Performance testing for smooth animations

## Deployment Options

### Web Hosting

- Deploy to services like Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting
- Configure HTTPS and proper caching headers
- Set up continuous deployment from repository

### Dedicated Hardware

- Raspberry Pi with Chromium in kiosk mode
- Custom boot script for auto-start
- Watchdog service for reliability

### Tablets and Displays

- Android/iOS tablets in full-screen mode
- Screen timeout disabled
- Auto-start on boot

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks

- Heartbeat API calls to verify display status
- Error logging to central service
- Automatic recovery mechanisms

### Updates

- Over-the-air updates via service worker
- Version management
- Rollback capability

### Usage Metrics

- Screen uptime
- Content display statistics
- User interaction (if applicable)

### Error Logging

- Implement error boundary in React
- Log errors to central service
- Include context information for debugging

### Health Monitoring

- Track memory usage
- Monitor network connectivity
- Log update success/failure

## Conclusion

This implementation guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing the MasjidConnect display screen application. By following this approach, you'll create a robust, cross-platform solution that works reliably in both online and offline environments while maintaining a beautiful and functional user interface aligned with the MasjidConnect design system.

The phased approach allows for iterative development and testing, ensuring each component works correctly before moving to the next phase. The technology choices provide maximum flexibility for future expansion while leveraging existing web development skills.
